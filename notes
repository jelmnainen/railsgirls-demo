All in all: written by a coder to a coder
    -links to mozilla docs are not very encouraging

/installation
should
-Select the option "Add Ruby executables to your PATH" in the installer
and
-Ruby 2.2 is not yet supported by dm-sqlite-adapter (do_sqlite3-0.10.16 does not include the binary for it),
    so you must use Ruby 2.1 or earlier
	-the linked rubyinstaller automatically installs 2.1.7, is this necessary or does it relate to other methods of install?
be indented one step further?

/html
	-minimal HTML page
		-how do I open a my-page.html in a browser?
	-basic HTML elements
		-how do I get an image I can use?
		-where can I get additional info and examples on how to use the tags?

/css
	-custom styles
		-how to point to the css file?
		-the solution picture is misleading because in html tutorial the image is added below text,
         but now it should be before text for float to take effect

/templating
    -"every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system" WTFFF
        -> should be "don't write the same stuff twice"
    -FIXME: there is a HUGE gap in templating section where we just jump to
     "yeah, find out how sinatra server serves static files". This is impossible for most.
    -"Check the source code of the page in your web browser" -> how?
    -"Create a directly" -> "create a directory"
    -"Now you can move the top and bottom parts of the code" -> what are 'top' and 'bottom'?
    -what is dynamically generated data?
    -change language in "First create a route for /pictures.html which stores" to "Let's create..." to avoid confusion about if
     the participant should do this herself or if we're going to show her how it's done
